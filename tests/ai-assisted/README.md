# AI-Assisted Test Suite

This directory contains unit tests that were created with the assistance of AI (GitHub Copilot -> Claude Sonnet 4.5).

## Test Files

- **filter.test.js** - Comprehensive tests for the `filter()` function
- **isEmpty.test.js** - Tests for the `isEmpty()` function (to be added)

## Approach

These tests were generated through:

1. Iterative prompting with GitHub Copilot
2. Refinement based on edge cases and coverage analysis
3. Review and validation of AI-generated test cases

The AI was used to:

- Generate comprehensive test cases covering various scenarios
- Identify edge cases that might be missed manually
- Create consistent test structure and naming conventions
- Achieve perfext code coverage efficiently
